## Introduction
Hello there! If you're here, you must probably be a fellow CSD/ISTD student in SUTD or an incoming one! This Obsidian graph network was made to try to visualise the track requirements and the relationship between different modules in CSD. Obsidian application is required to view the network graph. With the network graphing tool, I hope that it will help you visualise the requirements you need to fulfill and aid you in your track planning! :)

## Inspiration
Special thanks to the HASS module [02.137DH Introduction to Digital Humanities](https://hass.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-subjects/elective/02-137-introduction-digital-humanities) for the motivation to find mediums to convey appreciation of humanities through software a/o technologies. It was because of the course I chance upon Obsidian and decided to explore its features. I needed something to map in order to test out the network features in Obsidian. I remembered struggling to visualise the track requirements and its prerequisites when browsing through the tracks in CSD and hence decided to build this network.
